          <h2 class="section__title">What is ChardScript?</h2>
          <p>
            ChardScript is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-oriented programming, and data description.
<br><br>
ChardScript combines a simple procedural syntax with a powerful data description structure based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode with a registry-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, ideal for configuration, scripting, and prototyping fast.

          <h2 class="section__title">How was ChardScript created?</h2>
          <p>
            In the beginning, ChardScript was mainly used to create Discord Bot and named Chard but then the plan was abandoned due to the fact that this is not a programming language. On August 19, 2022, the Chard programming language was renamed and reworked by GamingMod and GggManSee.
<br><br>
On September 7, 2022, the programming language launched its first version and has a total of 20 keywords and 13 built-in functions.
<br><br>
On September 11, 2022, GggManSee officially left the group and stopped working together because it was too bored.

          <h2 class="section__title">Why choose ChardScript?</h2>
          <h3 class="section__title">ChardScript is fast</h3>
          <p>ChardScript has a well-deserved reputation for performance. Because it is built in languages â€‹like Lua or BASIC, ChardScript can run code quickly and accept reading code that is more than 10 million lines of code or much more.</p>
          <h3 class="section__title">ChardScript is small</h3>
          <p>ChardScript is less than 6MB in size and does not take up much space on the computer and is also considered a low-volume programming language to download.</p>
          <h3 class="section__title">ChardScript is powerful (but simple)</h3>
          <p>A fundamental concept in the design of ChardScript is to provide meta mechanisms for implementing features, rather than providing a bunch of features directly in the language. For example, although ChardScript is not a pure object-oriented language, it does provide meta mechanisms for implementing classes and inheritance. ChardScript's meta mechanisms provide an economy of concepts and keep the language compact, while allowing semantics to be extended in unique ways.</p>
          <h3 class="section__title">ChardScript is free</h3>
          <p>ChardScript is free and open source software, distributed under a very free license (well known MIT license). It can be used for any purpose, including commercial ones, completely free of charge. Just download and use.</p>
